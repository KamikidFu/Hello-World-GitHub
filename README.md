# Hello-World-GitHub
The first github repository from Kamikid following Hello World guide at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Hi there,
I am Yunhao Fu. English name is Kamikid, or for short, Kami. Become a lover of Computer Science since my childhood.
Still remember the heart-moving in the early of 00s when the first time my father brought the Internet to my home.
Somethings blinking on webpage from monitor attracted me, a little boy.
Now studying in Computer Science degree in the University of Waikato, who brought the Internet to New Zealand.
What the coincidence! And I wish that I may have a step on the moon of humanbeings' computer sceience.
Sincerely,
Yunhao Fu
